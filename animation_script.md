# Flux Notes on Voice animation

The following is the latest narration/script that will accompany the animation for describing Flux Notes on Voice.

### Script

We all want our experience with a doctor to be respectful. We want the doctor to listen to our story.  And above all, we expect strong care planning that leads to positive outcomes.

Fortunately, medicine now has the great potential to leverage massive amounts of health data to bring positive outcomes.

Unfortunately, the manual data entry required to put the data in the electronic health record drains doctors’ time and morale. Doctors spend more time DOCUMENTING medicine than engaging patients PRACTICING medicine.

Furthermore, administrative requirements skew what data is captured away from what informs the most complete and accurate picture of the patient. Much data is left unstructured or missing.

But it doesn’t have to be this way! We have an opportunity to redefine the future encounter into a more personal human experience. To one where time isn’t spent documenting, typing, staring into a screen…

… but rather spent engaging the patient. One where we all have the tools to stop drowning in data, and rather leverage its potential.

… A future where the patient’s values, the doctor’s expertise, and relevant data inform better plans of care. 

In this future, audio devices in the exam room capture natural conversation. Artificial intelligence is harnessed to identify structured data and automatically generate documentation. The doctor maintains focus on the patient and her care.

Flux Notes on Voice is a prototype application that demonstrates the voice capture concept with a functional engineering pipeline. Audio is captured, processed, and examined for 2 key data points. The new data is formatted and delivered to Flux Notes and the EHR.

Here’s how it works. Before meeting with the patient, the doctor opens Flux Notes on Voice to view the patient record. They are supplied with a well designed, easy to follow visual interface.

They start a clinical note from a template. The template identifies structured data elements that the Flux Notes on Voice system will listen for during the encounter. 

When the clinician greets and interacts with the patient, her ears and eyes are focused on them, not on a screen. Multi-modal technologies, from speech to visuals to touch interfaces, enhance rather than displace the human-human interaction that is central to the patient-doctor relationship.

The clinician begins the Flux Notes on Voice system.

It records the conversation and listens to everything the patient shares with the provider…

… and everything the provider shares with the patient.

The system identifies the data elements specified in the template and extracts the relevant structured health data automatically.

The new data is presented in the note for verification by provider and patient.

As the appointment ends, the clinician simply stops the recording.

The patient departs, feeling cared for and listened to. When the doctor later returns to Flux Notes to finalize the documentation…

most of the note has been auto-generated. She verifies accuracy and completeness…

… and signs the note.

Flux Notes on Voice lays the groundwork for the self-documenting encounter. So that the provider can capture valuable data AND reduce workload, and ultimately spend more time doing what is most important--

… listening and engaging with the patient and their needs. Promoting better outcomes. And working with the patient to make better decisions.
